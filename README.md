This project focuses on detecting insurance fraud using synthetic healthcare claims data. We applied data engineering techniques, including data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling), and machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to predict fraudulent claims. The dataset was balanced using SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and models were hyperparameter-tuned for optimal performance. Model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and visualizations (confusion matrix, ROC curves) were used to assess model accuracy and identify key fraud indicators. This workflow aids in optimizing fraud detection processes for health insurance providers, ensuring more accurate claim assessments and informed pricing strategies
